## Analysis and Challenges
One of main my main challenges was to reaquint my limited experience using Microsoft Excel. Application of formulas in Excel are somewhat new to me, but with the help of bith pervious online classes gave enough tools to figure each step of the module one (1). Linking files to performed the different tasks are very clear in the instructions given and prove very helpful to meet each task. The use of Statistical formulas to what is definaty requied by the client, in this case Louise, have to interpet to excatly what is reqiured sometimes seems unclear, your assessment might not match those that are requested.
