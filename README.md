# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
This report will indicate how well the different theater campaigns performed in relation to the their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
This will help Louise to plan more accurately when theater productions are to be held, in particular, the time of year and how long she should run each campaigns. The proper timing is required to capture more contributers in order to meet fundings goals, In addition, this will prevent cancellation of productions or failure of events. 
## Analysis and Challenges
One of main my main challenges was to reacquaint my limited experience using Microsoft Excel. Application of formulas in Excel are somewhat new to me, but with the help of both pervious online classes, enough tools were given to figure each step of the module one (1). Linking files to performed the different tasks are very clear in the instructions and prove very helpful to meet each task. The basic use of Statistical formulas employed to meet the request required by the client, in this case Louise, have to be interpet to excatly what is asked. It sometimes seems unclear, since, your solution might not match that of the client request. Wrong interpetation of the graphs and misuse of the data can lead to an improper assessment, and generate misguided results wich could lead the client going in the wrong direction.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month of May prove by far the best time for Louise to have her theater productions with December being the worst. December promotioms shows more unsuccesful campaigns 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Goals milestone are based on the amount of funding as well as contributers to each production. Between the dollar range of less than one thousand (1000) and forty five thousand (45000) a signifcant portion of Louise intentions was achieved. There exist some amount of lost in this range but much more significant reduction occur at values above the forty five thousand (45000) threshold.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Leading up the Hoildays season November thru December shows a dificult period for theater productions. Far less contributers got involve and most of Louise goals are not meet. The duration for campaigns that were successful was sightly greater than ones that failed or cancelled. This was used to offset the overall production cost.
## Results
#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- At the begining of the month of April, interest in theater productions are on the rise. This is an opportune time to input more campaigns to compensate for the slow period during rest of the year. 
- For the summer time, although there is a decline in Louise's goals, a significant difference between success and failure. Better marketing strategies can be employed to get more people to be interested in theater, since during this period there are much more competion from other activies.
#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- More realistic goals are needed for the campaigns, at the target of twenty thousand (20000), the productions at that point produce more unsuccessful goals. 
#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Live events are not used in the dataset
#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- A comparison between theater productions and others that did not meet thier goals. 
- How long each did each production lasted.
- The type of campaigns that were consistently unsuccessful.
