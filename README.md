# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
This report will indicate how well the different theater campaigns performed in relation to the their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
This analysis of data will help Louise to plan more accurately and provide information about when theater productions are to be held, in particular, the time of year and how long she should run each campaigns. From the analysis, the proper timing that is required to capture more contributers in order to meet fundings goals, and prevent cancellation of productions or failure of events will be determined. 
## Analysis and Challenges
One of my main challenges was to reacquaint my limited experience using Microsoft Excel. Application of formulas in Excel are somewhat new to me, but with the help of both pervious online classes, enough tools were given to figure each step of module one (1). Linking files to performed the different tasks are very clear in the instructions given, and prove very helpful to meet each task. The basic use of statistical formulas employed to provide the information as requested by the client, in this case Louise, must be interpeted exactly to benefit the client. It sometimes seems unclear, as the solution might not match that of the client's request. Wrong interpetation of the graphs and misuse of the data can lead to an improper assessment, and generate misguided results which could lead the client in the wrong direction.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the analysis of the data and the graphs produced, the month of May proved by far the best time for Louise to have her theater productions. Compared to the month of May, December reported the highest cancellations and failed events and therefore is the worst month for holding theater productions. December promotioms shows more unsuccesful campaigns 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Milestones are based on the amount of funding as well as contributers to each production. Between the dollar range of less than one thousand (1000) and forty five thousand (45000) a signifcant portion of Louise targets was achieved. There exist some amount of lost in this range but much more significant reduction occurred at values above the forty five thousand (45000) threshold.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Leading to the holiday season, November through December showed a difficult period for theater productions. Far less contributers got involved and most of Louise goals are not met. The duration for campaigns that were successful was slightly greater than ones that failed or cancelled. This was used to offset the overall production cost.
## Results
#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- At the begining of the month of April, interest in theater productions increased. This is an opportune time to input more campaigns to compensate for the slow period during the rest of the year. 
- For the summer time, although there is a decline in Louise's goals, there exist a significant difference between success and failure. Better marketing strategies can be employed to get more people to be interested in theater, since during this period there are much more competion from other activies.
#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- More realistic goals are needed for the campaigns at the target of twenty thousand (20000), the productions at that point produce more unsuccessful goals. 
#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Live events are not used in the dataset
#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- A comparison between theater productions and others that did not meet thier goals. 
- How long each did each production lasted.
- The type of campaigns that were consistently unsuccessful.
