# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
This report will indicate how well the different theater campaigns performed in relation to the their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
This will help Louise to conduct plan more accurately when theater productions are to be held, in particular, the time of year and how long she should run each campaigns. The proper timing is required to capture more contributers in order to meet fundings goals, In addition, this will prevent cancellation of productions or failure of events. 
## Analysis and Challenges
One of main my main challenges was to reacquaint my limited experience using Microsoft Excel. Application of formulas in Excel are somewhat new to me, but with the help of both pervious online classes gave enough tools to figure each step of the module one (1). Linking files to performed the different tasks are very clear in the instructions given and prove very helpful to meet each task. The basic use of Statistical formulas employed to meet the request required by the client, in this case Louise, have to be interpet to excatly what is asked, sometimes seems unclear, since, your solution might not match that of the client request. Worng interpetation of the graphs and misuse of the data can lead to an improper assessment, and generate misguided results wich could lead the client in the wrong direction.
